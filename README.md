Emeltal
====

Local ML voice chat using high-end models, aiming for a self contained, user-friendly out-of-the-box experience as much as possible.

This is a work in progress with frequent updates; [TestFlight builds are available here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/NTIomxyk).

## Emellink

A light helper app which can run on an iPhone or device with not enough processing power, which automatically detects and connects to Emeltal on the network and provides the same voice interface. [Testflight link for this app is here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/s0EYVO5P)

## Packages

- Emeltal heavily relies on the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) libraries for LLM processing and voice recognition.
- Text rendering uses [Ink](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink) to convert between Markdown and HTML.
- Uses my [PopTimer](https://github.com/ptsochantaris/pop-timer) for debouncing things.
